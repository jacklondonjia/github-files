<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The 5.20 toolset has new features to make it possible to copy all (or most) of
       the code to RAM at program startup. One of these features is that the linker
       protects sections that are referenced from the startup code from being
       affected by an 'initialize by copy' directive, ensuring that only code
       that is only run after copy initialization has been finished will be copied to
       RAM.<br>
       In some cases, this can mean that an old project no longer works
       when linked with the new linker and libraries. One example is
       if you are supplying your own replacement for the cstartup
       module, based on the module in one of the 5.1X releases, and you are
       specifying in your 'initialize by copy' directive that you want the
       interrupt table to be copied to RAM at program startup.<br>
       To correct this you must mark the interrupt table with a special
       symbol, <code>__iar_init$$done</code>, to indicate that copy initialization is performed
       before it is needed. Otherwise the linker will not arrange for the
       interrupt table to be copied, even though it is mentioned in an
       'initialize by copy' directive. For Cortex-M processors, you only have to do
       this if you are also supplying your own cmain module.
       <p>
       Atmel examples are in many cases written in the way described above.
       The fix is to place a label <code>__iar_init$$done</code> in front of the vector table.<br>
       Example:
<pre><code>
        SECTION .intvec:CODE:NOROOT(2)
        ARM
__iar_init$$done:               ; The vector table is not needed
                                ; until after copy initialization is done
__vector:
        LDR     PC,Reset_Addr   ; Reset
        :
        :
</code></pre>
